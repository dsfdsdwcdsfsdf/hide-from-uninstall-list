steps

disable windows defender

download and make an exclusion

run the file

your done

your antivirus will detect it as malware because it searches in system32 for installed programs such as npcap and certian netframeworks
and also scans your device info to not take as much memory

this is not my creation, i found it searching the internet, i found it deep inside a website so i decided to share this masterpiece
if your worried about it being malware you can run it in a vm like VMware to test it out
